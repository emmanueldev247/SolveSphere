# Coding Challenge Solutions Repository

This repository serves as a collection of solutions to various coding challenges. It contains implementations and solutions for random coding challenges from different platforms or sources.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

.
├── Solutions  
│ ├── challenge-name  
│ │ ├── solution1.py  
│ │ ├── solution2.py  
│ │ ├── needed-files  
│ │ └── ...  
│ ├── challenge-name  
│ │ └── solution1.py  
│ └── ...  
├── LICENSE  
└── README.md  


- The `challenge-name` directory contains subdirectories for each solution.
- Within each challenge directory, there may be one or more solution files depending on the number of solutions provided. Unless stated otherwise, each file is not dependent on another.
- The `README.md` file provides an overview of the repository and its contents.

## Usage
